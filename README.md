🚗 Uber Supply-Demand Gap Analysis

This project analyzes Uber ride request data to identify the gap between customer ride demand and driver supply, particularly during different times of the day and across pickup locations.

📌 Problem Statement

Uber faces a supply-demand mismatch during peak hours—either due to driver cancellations or no cabs being available. This project aims to:

- Identify 'when' and 'where' these mismatches occur
- Analyze user request patterns
- Suggest data-driven recommendations to minimize the gap

🧰 Tools Used

- Excel – Data Cleaning & Dashboard (Optional)
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib) – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- SQL – Insight Queries (Optional)
- PowerPoint – Final Presentation
- Jupyter Notebook – EDA Code Execution

---

📊 Dataset

- `Uber_Request_Data_Cleaned.xlsx`: Cleaned version of Uber ride request logs including timestamps, pickup points, and ride status.

---

📈 EDA Highlights

- Time Slot Creation: Grouped requests into time ranges like Early Morning, Afternoon, etc.
- Status Distribution: Visualized completed, cancelled, and unavailable rides.
- Heatmaps: Showcased how supply-demand imbalance varies across time and pickup location.
- Key Metrics:
  - ~18.7% rides were 'cancelled'
  - ~39.3% rides had 'no cars available'
  - Maximum issues observed in 'Early Morning' and 'Late Night'

💡 Recommendations

- 📍 Introduce 'Rush Hour Incentives' for drivers (especially Early Morning from City)
- 🌙 Deploy 'Night Shift' drivers to address Late Night unavailability at Airport
- 🔄 Implement 'real-time dynamic pricing' to attract more supply when demand surges
